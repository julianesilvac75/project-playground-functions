# Project Playground Functions - Trybe, Class 16-B

The challenge was to write JavaScript code that utilizes variables and primitive types, use language concepts such as dynamic typing and logical/arithmetic/assignment operators, create code with conditional structures, manipulate arrays, and use the `for` loop. Additionally, it required breaking down large problems into smaller ones and applying programming logic to problem-solving.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript

## Requirements
- [x] Create a function using the && operator.
- [x] Create a function that calculates the area of a triangle.
- [x] Create a function that splits a sentence into an array of strings.
- [x] Create a function that uses string concatenation.
- [x] Create a function that calculates the number of points for a team in a football championship.
- [x] Create a function that calculates the repetition of the largest number within an array.
- [x] Create a Rat Hunt function that calculates the distances between the cats and the rat and returns which one will reach the rat first.
- [x] Create a FizzBuzz function that returns strings depending on the number's divisor.
- [x] Create a function that encodes and decodes a string, swapping vowels for numbers and vice versa.
- [x] Create a Technology Lists function that returns a list of objects.
- [x] Create a Phone Number function that, when given an array of numbers, returns a phone number with area code.
- [x] Create a Triangle Existence Condition function.
- [x] Create a Welcome to Trybe's Bar function that returns how many glasses of water the user should drink based on the number of drinks they've already had.

## Learnings
The project was quite challenging and provided me with the opportunity to practice programming logic, a fundamental skill in which I still have much to develop. The practice of breaking down large problems into smaller ones has been incredibly valuable and will be of great help in future projects. The most significant learning from this project was with ESLint, as I had some trouble refactoring my code to address all the errors it pointed out. However, this resulted in much cleaner, readable, and accessible code.

## Agradecimento
- My sincere gratitude to [Gabriel Rodrigues Leite](https://github.com/gabrielrodriguesleite), who provided me with highly relevant comments that helped me refactor the code to be even more accurate.
